### Accessiblity Testing

Using lighthouse to rate the accesability of the webpage. Results are:
##### Index

##### Guide
![Score](assets/readme/score.lighthouse.early.p2.png)<br>

### Manual Testing
 - I have tested this website on diffrent web browsers.
 - I have tested that the website is responsive to diffrent screen sizes. It works in multiple diffrent screen sizes.
 - I have tested the links in the nav and the footer. they all work
 - I have tested the text and its fonts are readable and scroll where necessary.

### Unresolved Bugs
#### The Half And Half 2.0
  - Sometimes when pressing the button post having pressed it the first time the test area shrinks to half, see "oversized Test Area" bugfix
  - other times it remains large, susspect it has to do with clicking the yellow screen

#### Score log
   - JavaScript works fine in index yet causes errors in score.html
   - Something in the code in JS is causing the problem
   - Have tried multiple solutions yet is still unresolved for now

### Fixed Bugs

#### Halved Area
  - In index.html the test area ended up in half often.
  - Choosing to sidestep the issue by hiding p1 along with the test area.

#### Oversized Test Area
  - During development i used min height and min width to fix other issues and the code ended up redundant.
  - Then it started causing sizing issues for the test area in index.html.
  - Discovering why, the code was then removed.
